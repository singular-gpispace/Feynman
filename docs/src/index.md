# Feynman

Documentation for [Feynman](https://github.com/singular-gpispace/Feynman.jl).

The package Feynman computes complete set of IBP identities of the Feynman integral associated to a given Feynman graph using the powerful module-intersection integration-by-parts (IBP) method, suitable for multi-loop and multi-scale Feynman integral reduction. It will provide an application programming interface(API) in OSCAR to use packages NeatIBP, pfd-parallel to make this computation much faster.The package Feynman is based on the computer algebra system OSCAR and is provided as a package for the Julia programming language.
